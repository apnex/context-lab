# context-lab - decision register

The director's rulings on context-lab, one record per ruling.\
A decision register in the form mission-kit's `AR4` type prescribes: a ruling is changed only by a later row that supersedes or amends it, never by editing the row.

---

## Status

**Authority.**\
The director, for every row; rows are drafted by agents.

**Earlier rulings held elsewhere.**\
The rulings that founded this component were made while working in mission-kit and are recorded in its register: `0087` (the universal part of agent evaluation is a component in its own repository) and `0088` (its name and north star).\
They are not copied here; this register starts at the vision.

## Decision records

| id | date | ruling | authority | status | lineage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0001 | 2026-10-10 | The vision in `VISION.md` is ratified. | director | ratified | - |
| 0002 | 2026-10-10 | context-lab absorbs every existing evaluation mechanism of its first users: comprehension runs, adherence runs, human preference judging, and classify-then-verify judging chains. | director | ratified | - |
| 0003 | 2026-10-10 | A project pack holds data and, at a few fixed points each with a stated contract, project scripts: measuring outcomes, building context variants, and checking declarations. | director | ratified | - |

### 0001

**Ruling.**\
`VISION.md` is ratified as it stood at this commit.

**How it was reached.**\
Each section was settled in a guided dialogue with the director - the north star, what this is and is not, succeeding, and what holding it does not authorise - then audited by an agent that did not write it.\
The audit's findings were applied, and three wording points were ruled by the director: models are declared factors in an experiment, "anyone" means anyone holding an experiment's record, and agents are language-model agents acting with tools.

**Alternatives refuted.**\
Ratifying after further changes, or deferring - offered, not chosen.

### 0002

**Ruling.**\
context-lab is the home of all four mechanisms its first users run today.

**Alternatives refuted.**\
Comprehension and adherence only, leaving human preference and classify-then-verify judging in their projects - refuted because the vision requires that judgement not made by a person is checked against theirs, and classify-then-verify is a judging method any project can use.\
Adherence only - refuted because the vision measures comprehension and behaviour each in its own right.

### 0003

**Ruling.**\
A project pack may carry scripts at fixed hook points with stated contracts.

**Alternatives refuted.**\
Data only, with anything code-like first generalised into the core - refuted because both first users already hold project-specific code of exactly these kinds, and the core would grow with, and wait on, every project's needs.

**Consequence.**\
The core runs project code, so each hook's inputs, outputs and access are bounded by its contract.
